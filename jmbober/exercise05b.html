    <p> Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum

     <p> I'm walking fast through the traffic lights / busy streets and busy lives / and all we know / is touch and go / We are alone with our changing minds / We fall in love till it hurts or bleeds or fades in time / And I never saw you coming / And I'll never be the same / You come around and the armor falls / Pierce the room like a cannonball / now all we know / is don't let go / We are alone just you and me / Up in your room and our slates are clean / Just twin fire signs / Four blue eyes / So you were never a saint / And I loved in shades of wrong / We learn to live with the pain / Mosaic broken hearts / But this love is brave and wild / And I never saw you coming / And I'll never be the same / This is a state of grace / This is the worthwhile fight / Love is a ruthless game unless you play it good and right / These are the hands of fate / You're my achilles heel / This is the golden age of something good and right and real / And I never saw you coming / And I'll never be the same / And I never saw you coming / And I'll never be the same / (So you were never a saint / and I loved in shades of wrong / We learn to live with the pain / mosaic broken hearts / but this love is brave and wild) / This is a state of grace / This is the worthwhile fight / Love is a ruthless game / Unless you play it good and right.
