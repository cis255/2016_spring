Advances in scientific research and technology have lead to dramatic improvements in our ability to produce food and feed; however, perceived risks associated with many of these advancements now threaten food and environmental safety. In order to serve as future leaders and change agents in agriculture, as well as to act as informed citizens, students must gain an awareness of and appreciation for the diverse array of perspectives surrounding current issues in crop and food production. Students will explore the scientific and ethical bases of issues associated with agricultural and food systems. Activities are designed to support students with engaging in productive discussions about different perspectives of issues related to crop and food production.",

The regulation of energy is closely tied to environmental regulation of the impacts of energy exploration, recovery, generation, and transmission. The course will cover the energy and environmental regulations addressing conventional fossil-fuel based electrical generating operations as well as traditional energy supply and distribution such as the electric power grid; coal mining, transport, and storage, oil exploration, recovery, transport and refining; and natural gas exploration, recovery and transport. This course will also cover alternate energy systems and the applicable regulatory requirements impacting the design, development, installation and operation of solar, wind, hydro, geothermal, nuclear and biomass systems. Students will learn how to identify general legal issues related to energy systems and their environmental impacts. Students will also learn about the costs of energy production and usage. This course will examine the technical issues that must be addressed in order to obtain the permits and necessary licenses to install and operate electrical generating systems and other energy sources. In addition to the legal issues, the course will also address ethical issues related to the use and depletion of natural resources as well as the actual and potential environmental harm caused by energy related operations.
